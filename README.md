# Introduction

Using it you can host your own server and create a community for you, your friends, and potentially others to join and spend wonderful times together. One of the key strengths of the **pufferblow** is its robust security measures. Being open-source and free to use, it ensures your privacy as it implements advanced encryption algorithms such as Blowfish and bcrypt for data hashing and encryption, making the **pufferblow** a secure choice for hosting your own server.
