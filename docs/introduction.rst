Introduction
============

The **pufferblow** is the official open-source server for **pufferblow**. Using it you can host your own server and create a community for you, your friends, and potentially others to join and spend wonderful times together. One of the key strengths of the **pufferblow** is its robust security measures. Being open-source and free to use, it ensures your privacy as it implements advanced encryption algorithms such as Blowfish and bcrypt for data hashing and encryption, making the **pufferblow** a secure choice for hosting your own server.
Unlike many other chat services that offer little control to the server owner, such as Discord and Guilded, **pufferblow** stands apart. With **pufferblow**, you have the ability to host your own server using **pufferblow** and customize it according to your preferences.

The ideology of pufferblow
==============================

This software enables users to host their own servers or instances while maintaining a consistent user experience across all these servers. Furthermore, users only need to create a single account on one server, which will be synchronized across all instances (aka fediverse network).

.. note::

   As of version **v0.0.1-beta**, **pufferblow** does not yet support the Fediverse. However, this feature is planned for future releases. The primary reason for creating **pufferblow** was to develop a Fediverse-compatible Discord-like chat service, which aligns with the ethos of the Fediverse itself.
