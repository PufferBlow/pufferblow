Introduction to PufferBlow
==============================

What is PufferBlow?
===================

**PufferBlow** is an open-source, decentralized chat platform that puts you back in control of your online community. Unlike traditional chat services like Discord, Slack, or Guilded, PufferBlow gives you the power to host your own server on hardware you control, ensuring your conversations, data, and community rules remain entirely yours.

Think of it as Discord, but without the corporate middleman. You and your community have complete autonomy over:

* **Your data privacy** - No algorithmic eavesdropping or data mining
* **Community standards** - Set your own rules and moderation policies
* **Server customization** - Configure everything from user limits to file storage
* **Data portability** - Your chat history stays with you, not locked in someone else's cloud

Why Choose Self-Hosting?
========================

In today's world of centralized social platforms, your community data is often just another asset to be monetized or analyzed. PufferBlow represents a return to community-owned communication:

**Privacy First**
    Advanced encryption using Blowfish and bcrypt algorithms protects your messages and user data. No hidden trackers, no algorithmic feeds pushing content you don't want.

**Complete Control**
    As a server owner, you decide who joins, what rules apply, and how your community operates. Scale up or down as needed without platform restrictions.

**Censorship Resistance**
    Your server, your rules. No corporate takedowns or policy changes can silence your community. If your server stays online, your community persists.

**Future-Proof**
    Open-source and free to use, PufferBlow grows with community needs rather than business decisions.

**True Ownership**
    Your server means your data. Export conversations, migrate to new hosts, or backup everything - no vendor lock-in keeping you trapped.

The Decentralized Future: Fediverse Integration
===============================================

PufferBlow embraces the **fediverse** vision - a connected network of independent servers that work together seamlessly. Just as email lets you communicate across different providers (Gmail to Outlook), fediverse-compatible platforms allow cross-server communication and account portability.

**Current Status:**
    PufferBlow v0.0.1-beta is fully functional for independent server hosting with all core chat features.

**Future Vision:**
    Multi-server compatibility allowing users to interact across different PufferBlow instances, just like how Mastodon users can follow and communicate with users on different servers.

**Our Mission:**
    To create a Discord-like experience that respects user privacy, community autonomy, and interoperability - combining the best of modern chat UX with the principles of the decentralized web.
